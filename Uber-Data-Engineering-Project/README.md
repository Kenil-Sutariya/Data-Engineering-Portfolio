# ðŸš–ðŸš– UBER Data Engineering Project ðŸš•ðŸš• | Modern Engineering Project with GCP

## Overview

This project delves into the world of Uber data analytics by employing modern data engineering practices on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 
It focuses on building an efficient ETL pipeline using Mage.ai, managing data with BigQuery and Cloud Storage, and visualizing insights using Looker Studio. 
This project aims to showcase how powerful and scalable cloud-based tools can be leveraged to extract, transform, and analyze large datasets.
